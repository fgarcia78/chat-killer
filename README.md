===========

Chrome/Chromium extension to kill (remove) chat component in edx.org's CS-169.2x course.

# Installation

- Download the extension on a directory of your computer
- Go to Extensions page in Chrome or Chromium (chrome://extensions)
- Make sure that 'Developer mode' is active
- Click on 'Load unpacked extension' and look for the path where you saved the extension; the extension will load and its icon will appear besides the address bar

# How to use

Just click the extension icon when you don't want to show the chat component of the course!

The extension simply looks for the DOM element of the chat iframe and kills it.
