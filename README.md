chat-killer
===========

Chrome/Chromium extension to automatically kill the chat component in edx.org's CS-169.2x course.

## Installation

- Download the extension on a directory of your computer
- Go to Extensions page in Chrome or Chromium ([chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions))
- Make sure that **'Developer mode'** is active
- Click on **'Load unpacked extension'** and look for the path where you saved the extension; the extension will load and its icon and information will appear in the list

## How to use

Nothing to do: The extension will remove automatically the chat component in any page of the CS-169.2x course. Go to the extension Options if you want to disable it.

The extension simply looks for the DOM element of the chat iframe and kills it.
